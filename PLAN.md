# Galley: state and plan

Rewritten 2026-10-25 after round 2, which finished or measured every task of the round 1 plan
(`git show 2287de8:PLAN.md`). Read the rules at the end before the first commit.

## Where it stands

| check | v19 (published 2026-10-12) | version 23 (published 2026-10-26) | version 25 (2026-10-28) |
|---|---|---|---|
| corpus compiles (LaTeX-examples, 716 documents present) | 705 | 706 | 706 |
| corpus PDFs equal to a desktop TeX Live 2026's | 615 of 704 (87.4 %) | 700 of 705 (99.3 %) | 703 of 705 (99.7 %) |
| TeX passes over the whole corpus | not counted | 995 (1,471 without latexmk's first-run `.aux`) | 995 |
| `test/engines.py` | 22/22 | 22/22 (its PSTricks check now asks for drawn lines) | 22/22 |
| `tex/native/xindy/test.cjs` (against CLISP's xindy) | 11/11 | 11/11 | 11/11 |
| TeX Live's 220 Asymptote examples as a desktop's asy draws them | not measured | against a native asy 3.09: 216 (196 equal PDFs, 12 equal failures, 7 random by design, 1 equal alone); 4 open | against the desktop's asy 3.11: 218 (201 equal PDFs, the 3D ones rendered as bitmaps; 10 equal failures; 7 random by design); 2 open: 1 numerical, `slope` out of memory |
| edits on the typeset page landing exactly, undone byte for byte (`test/editor_corpus.py`) | not measured | 780 of 780, in the 222 documents with text, a formula, a cell or a footnote; 211 of 211 edited projects compile | as version 23 (page unchanged) |
| artifact size (limit 256 MB) | 250.0 MB | 249.7 MB | 252.3 MB |

Version 23 changed only the page (task 13): its `dist/tex` is version 22's byte for byte, so the
TeX rows are version 22's runs. Version 24 changed Asymptote (tasks 17 and 18: `asy.wasm`, the
shaders in the tree, the worker's pipe to TeX), version 25 again (task 19: GSL, FFTW and Eigen,
and the worker letting a program go after a run that leaves it above 1 GiB), and the desktop
reference was repaired (task 2); version 25's corpus rows are version 22's runs, with the three
corpus documents that run asy compiled again and compared with the repaired desktop.

Equal means: the same number of pages, the same text on each page (`pdftotext -layout`,
whitespace collapsed), and no page with more than 0.1 % of its pixels differing by more than
64 of 255 at 72 dpi in grey. Both sides run with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000` and
`FORCE_SOURCE_DATE=1`. The desktop is Ubuntu 26.10's TeX Live 2026.20260711 with the fonts its
packages recommend (`dev/fetch_tl26.sh`, `dev/tl26.sh`), run through latexmk with rules for what
Galley's worker runs between passes (`dev/pdfcompare.py`). Results: `dev/corpus-results.jsonl`
and `dev/pdfcompare-results.jsonl`.

### What round 2 changed

- **The tree is TeX Live 2026.20260711.** Ubuntu 26.10's TeX Live packages (pinned by
  sha512 in `tex/fetch_inputs.sh`) are laid over the tree in BusyTeX's release (TeX Live 2026 of
  March) and win for every file they share; BusyTeX keeps its engine's configuration. The three
  formats are made by Galley's own engines from that tree (`tex/build_formats.py`). The LaTeX
  kernel is 2026-06-01 (v19: 2025-11-01). `GALLEY_TL_FIRST=0` builds v19's tree.
- **Bugs the comparison found, fixed:**
  - Another pass when a pass read a file it then wrote with other content (latexmk's rule, from
    TeX's `-recorder` file). Tables of contents had kept the page numbers of the pass before.
  - `texmf-dist/makeindex` was left out of the tree, so `nomencl.ist` and every other
    makeindex style were missing: nomenclatures never printed.
  - Files of one name in several TeX Live folders were dropped: XeTeX's own `pstricks.con`
    was missing from the tree.
  - And even with it there, TeX never read it: run as applets of BusyTeX's one binary, the
    engines had the program name "busytex", and kpathsea's default search path for that name
    puts `tex/generic` first. XeLaTeX read PSTricks' generic `pstricks.con`, wrote `ps:` specials
    xdvipdfmx cannot draw, and every PSTricks figure under XeLaTeX came out blank (five corpus
    documents). `engines.py` passed because it only asked for no errors. The engines now run
    with TeX Live's `-progname` (pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex, latex), and the test asks for
    drawing operators on the page: 0 on the old worker, now there.
  - pgfplots' gnuplot plots all write `<job>.pgf-plot.table`; a second table of the same size
    written within the millisecond the folder was copied in looked untouched and never reached
    TeX, which drew the first curve again. Copies now carry the time 0.
  - sansmathaccent was not in the tree; beamer loads it whenever it is installed, so math in
    sans slides used another italic than on a desktop.
  - A first compile ran two passes where latexmk runs one: latexmk starts from the `.aux` a
    one page document writes. Galley does too now; the corpus needs 995 TeX passes, not 1,471.
  - minted: a file latexminted deleted stayed on TeX's side, and its stale message turned off
    highlighting for the rest of the document. Deletions now pass between the programs' file
    systems. Its Python wheels are the ones TeX Live's minted 3.8 bundles (latexminted 0.7).
  - gnuplot (npm's gnuplot-wasm 0.1.0) failed every `igamma()` ("Igamma: errno = 0").
    gnuplot 6.0.2, the desktop's version, is now built here with that check fixed.
  - TeX Live ships EC and Cyrillic (LH) metrics for some sizes only; a desktop makes the others
    with mktextfm. `tex/build_pk.py` now makes them (T1, TS1, T2A: 566 files, byte for byte
    what mktextfm makes). Russian headings had vanished.
  - bold-extra's fonts (bold typewriter for listings' keywords) were missing.
  - A run with "No pages of output" left an empty PDF that counted as success.
  - Found by the Asymptote comparison (task 9): each program's and each TeX instance's stack
    pointer, a WebAssembly global the memory restore does not cover, sank a little every run
    (callMain leaves argv on the stack). Ghostscript's 64 KB stack ran into its heap after about
    25 of asy's runs in one session: the page hung or crashed, and every example after it failed.
    Every run now starts from the first run's stack pointer. Files a program left open when it
    exited (dvips its `.dvi`, every run) are closed after it.
  - asy's pipe cache handed texpath an earlier label's outlines (Ghostscript runs on one file
    name for every label), and kept the empty answer of a Ghostscript not loaded yet. 3D labels
    swapped places, lost lines or failed ("reading array of length 0"). Ghostscript now also
    gets its standard input (texpath answers its page prompts).
  - media9 (for PRC figures; its Flash players stay out) and eulervm were not in the tree.
  - Found by the editor run (task 13), on the page:
    - siunitx knew six units, so `\celsius`, `\hertz`, `\bit`, units from `\DeclareSIUnit` and
      siunitx inside formulas showed as red source. Now the units and prefixes siunitx defines,
      powers, `\per` in its three modes, digit grouping, the decimal marker, rounding, ranges,
      lists and `\ang`, with `\sisetup` and the package options (`src/siunitx.js`). Formula
      errors on the 35 corpus documents that use siunitx: 402 → 97, the rest the documents'
      computed macros and typos.
    - The equation field hands back the text it was given until the first keystroke (MathLive
      0.110), so a formula it could not read (an `array` with `*4{c}` columns, `\tikzmark`)
      passed the round trip check and was then rewritten from what the field kept: the Jordan
      matrices lost their entries, and undo did not bring them back. The check now reads the
      field's own serialization; such a formula opens as source, with a note.
    - For the same reason the smallest patch compared the source with the field's normalized
      spelling (`x_n` with `x_{n}`) and rewrote whole rows; it lines them up ignoring braces now.
    - Plain brackets around a fraction became `\left( \right)` whenever their row was edited,
      which changes the PDF. They stay as written; brackets typed in the field still get them.
    - An environment made with `\newenvironment` that opens a `tikzpicture` (the Karnaugh maps)
      had its body read as text, and a formula edit there landed in `\usepackage{tikz}`. Such
      environments are source blocks now, drawn in the PDF.
    - `\tikzstyle`, `\pgfmathdeclarefunction`, `\newglossaryentry`, `\DTLloaddb`, `\psset` and
      other setup commands in the document body showed their arguments as text; making "sqrt"
      in a pgfmath formula bold broke the compile. They are hidden now. Commands that set a
      file, a database or a drawing (`\lstinputlisting`, `\includepdf`, `\DTLdisplaydb`,
      `\DTLpiechart`, `\pgfplotstabletypeset`, chemfig's `\chemfig` and `\arrow`) are one block,
      so their file names, keys and code are not typed into; chemformula's `\ch` is set like
      mhchem's `\ce`.
- **Programs built here from source** (`tex/build_tools.sh`): dvips, Asymptote 3.09 now with
  GLM and XDR (WebGL, V3D and PRC output), and since version 24 OpenGL through Mesa's OSMesa
  (task 17), xindy, and gnuplot 6.0.2. A clean `GALLEY_SRC` rebuilds all four.
- **Size:** the niche packages TeX Live 2026 added (one school's beamer theme, thesis classes,
  icon and card sets) go to the mirror only (`DROP` in `tex/build_tree.py`), as do the Aurical
  fonts.
- **Reproducible:** `tex/fetch_inputs.sh` into an empty folder, then
  `build_tree.py tree && build_tree.py packs && node build.mjs`, gives `dist/tex` byte for
  byte as `dev/dist-manifest.txt` lists it (checked 2026-10-26 for version 22: 268 files equal,
  from the committed `inputs/` in an empty work folder; the downloads there were the ones
  already fetched, which `fetch_inputs.sh` checks by hash).
- **Desktop reference fixed:** the fonts TeX Live's packages recommend (Debian moves Linux
  Libertine, Gentium, Noto and others out of the tree), the font databases, and CLISP for xindy;
  on 2026-10-28 asy's own libraries and an X display for it (task 2).

## Building

1. `npm ci` (node 22); `pip install lz4 playwright numpy`; Chromium for Playwright through
   `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`; `poppler-utils` for the comparisons.
2. `tex/fetch_inputs.sh` lays out `$GALLEY_WORK` (default `/tmp/eng`): about 3 GB, rerunnable,
   every download checked against its hash.
3. `python3 tex/build_tree.py tree && python3 tex/build_tree.py packs && node build.mjs` gives
   `dist/`. Use this, not `build_all.sh`: the formats, PK fonts, metrics and font caches in
   `inputs/generated*.tar.gz` were made for exactly this tree. When the tree changes,
   `tex/build_all.sh` remakes them all, then pack them again (`fetch_inputs.sh` says how).
4. Programs built for Galley are committed in `tex/vendor/`; `tex/build_tools.sh` rebuilds them
   (`GALLEY_VENDOR` to build elsewhere and compare).
5. The desktop TeX Live 2026 for comparisons: `dev/fetch_tl26.sh` (into `/opt/tl26`, about
   6 GB), then `dev/tl26.sh <program>`; its asy needs an X display for 3D (`xvfb` on the build
   machine: `pdfcompare.py` starts one, for `asycompare.py` use `xvfb-run -a`).

Tests:
- `cd test && python3 engines.py` (and the other `*.py` there; they serve `dist/`)
- `node --no-experimental-fetch tex/native/xindy/test.cjs`
- `node test/model.test.mjs` and the other `*.test.mjs` (CI runs them)
- one document: `DIST=dist python3 dev/texrun.py DIR main.tex auto 300`; where its time goes:
  `dev/profile.py le/<path>`
- the corpus: clone MartinThoma/LaTeX-examples at `8bfd313b8d98`,
  `CORPUS_REPO=... SDE=1700000000 PDF_DIR=pdf python3 dev/corpus_full.py OUT.jsonl`. About
  100 minutes on 2 cores. Run nothing else meanwhile: the harness limit is 240 s.
- the comparison: `DESKTOP_CACHE=desk python3 dev/pdfcompare.py OUT.jsonl pdf CMP.jsonl`, then
  `dev/pdfcompare_report.py CMP.jsonl dev/pdfcompare-classes.json`
- Asymptote: `GLM=1 MESA=1 dev/build_asy_native.sh`, then
  `ASY_NATIVE=<its build folder> dev/asycompare.py OUT.jsonl FILES...`
- the editor: `test/editor_corpus.py OUT.jsonl` (about 40 minutes of edits, then 20 of compiles)

## Tasks of round 1: status

0. **Parity with v19.** Done in round 2's first commit: manifest equal, 22/22, 11/11, every
   document ok in the baseline ok again.
1. **No hard coded work folder.** Done.
2. **PDFs against a desktop TeX Live 2026.** Done. 703 of the 705 documents both sides
   compiled are equal (99.7 %). The other two have their cause in `dev/pdfcompare-classes.json`,
   and neither is Galley's: one Metropolis deck whose Fira Sans the desktop's fontconfig lists
   but XeTeX cannot load (it falls back to Computer Modern serif; Galley has no Fira, says so and
   keeps Latin Modern Sans), and one document whose pixels are equal but whose opening quote has
   no Unicode mapping in Debian's own build of Linux Libertine. Until 2026-10-28 the corpus's
   three Asymptote figures differed too, blank or of height 0 on the desktop, which round 2 put
   down to the desktop having no display. Wrong: the desktop's asy never started. Its libraries
   (readline, GLEW, freeglut, libsigsegv, GL) were missing from the reference
   (`dev/tl26-packages.txt`), and Debian's asy looks for its base modules in
   `/usr/share/asymptote`. With them and an X display (`pdfcompare.py` starts Xvfb; the
   desktop's asy renders 3D through a window, with Mesa 26's llvmpipe) all three are equal. One
   document compiles in Galley only: `class-diagram` needs an `mpost` step from its Makefile
   that neither side runs, and latexmk calls the missing figure a failure.
3. **A larger corpus (arXiv).** Blocked: arxiv.org is not reachable from the build machine (its
   proxy refuses it, as it refuses CTAN). Ready to run: `dev/arxiv_corpus.py` (seeded sample of
   1,000 papers, 84 per year 2015 to 2026, a PDF-only paper replaced by the next of its year,
   one request per 3 s) and `.github/workflows/arxiv.yml` (sample, fetch, build, 8 shards
   compiling with Galley and with the desktop TeX Live, results committed to the branch
   `arxiv-results`). Two ways to unblock, the owner's choice: allow `arxiv.org` and
   `export.arxiv.org` for this project's Claude sessions (claude.ai, Settings, Capabilities),
   or start the workflow (about 20 runner hours, paid from the private repository's Actions
   minutes). See task 16.
4. **One TeX Live, 2026.** Done, with one deviation: the TeX Live 2026 files come from Ubuntu
   26.10's packages, not from CTAN's `texlive2026.iso`, because CTAN is not reachable from the
   build machine either; they are TeX Live 2026.20260711, pinned by hash. Compile rate 705 →
   706, match rate 87.4 % → 99.3 %, artifact 249.7 MB, new manifest.
5. **Native programs from source.** Done. The vendored dvips, asy, xindy and gnuplot are this
   round's builds by `build_tools.sh` from an empty `GALLEY_SRC`; tests and corpus as above.
   xindy differs from v19's only in build paths embedded by ECL (`/tmp/src/eclwasm` then).
6. **Corpus timeouts.** Done. No document of the corpus needs the 240 s limit now:
   `3d-gaussian-distribution` takes 63 s in one pass measured alone (two passes before
   latexmk's first-run `.aux`), 81 s in the full run, where the desktop's latexmk took 69 s;
   `exponential-functions-gif` (100 pgfplots frames) 158 s alone in two passes, as latexmk runs
   it, 205 s in the full run (desktop: 197 s). `facharbeit-rsa` takes 11 s (minted). With another
   job on the two cores both had passed 240 s. `write-math-ba-paper` hangs on the desktop TeX
   Live 2026 too, at `\num{\totalCollectedRecordings{}}` (siunitx 3): the document's own.
7. **`Programmierparadigmen.tex`.** Done: the document's own (`\usetkzobj{all}`, gone in
   tkz-euclide 5), shown with the desktop log.
8. **gnuplot** `draw-csv`, `high-order-knot`: done: the documents' own (a Makefile step;
   gnuplot 6 has no `latex` terminal).
9. **Asymptote coverage.** Done. `dev/asycompare.py` draws each of the 220 examples in TeX Live's
   `utils/asymptote/examples` with Galley and with another asy: the desktop's own (Ubuntu's asy
   3.11, with its libraries since task 2, under Xvfb), and a native asy 3.09 built from the
   same source with the same features (`dev/build_asy_native.sh`: GLM, OSMesa, GSL, FFTW,
   Eigen, no GC); labels by the desktop TeX Live. Version 25 against the desktop's: 201 PDFs
   equal, the 3D ones rendered as bitmaps (`BezierSurface` and `triads` compared by the PDFs
   they write under other names); 10 examples fail on both sides the same way (missing `.obj`
   data, ConTeXt, image based lighting files from the network, ones that write no PDF); 7 draw
   random data, so the desktop's asy differs from itself between runs; `SierpinskiSponge`
   differs in 0.11 % of the pixels at 72 dpi (the limit is 0.1 %) along edges where coplanar
   faces meet and the depth test comes out the other way: floating point in WebAssembly against
   x86-64; `slope` runs out of memory in Galley only (task 19). Against the native asy: the
   same, but `slope` fails there too (without the GC). Results with their causes:
   `dev/asycompare-desktop-results.jsonl`, `dev/asycompare-results.jsonl`. The first run found
   three bugs, fixed above: the stack pointer, the pipe cache, Ghostscript's standard input.
10. **Asymptote 3D like the desktop.** WebGL (`-f html`), V3D and PRC output work (GLM, and XDR
    through `native/rpc`); rendered bitmaps since version 24 (task 17).
11. **The programs reported as missing.** No corpus document calls R, bib2gls or inkscape.
    R: webR 0.6.0 is 48.6 MB (R.wasm alone 18.1 MB) and the artifact has 6.3 MB left; a page on
    claude.ai may not fetch it at run time either (its `connect-src` is `'self'` only). A
    self-hosted Galley could load it from the mirror. bib2gls (Java): TeaVM's compiler comes
    only from Maven Central, unreachable here; CheerpJ's runtime is served only from its
    vendor's CDN (and not licensed for bundling); Doppio (npm `doppiojvm` 0.5.0) is
    unmaintained since 2017 and needs a JDK 8 class library. inkscape has no browser build.
12. **xindy start.** Measured, not adopted: loading xindy's kernel as ECL bytecode starts in
    293 to 350 ms against 321 to 418 ms from source (fresh processes), of which ECL's own start
    is about 200 ms. Not worth a second link and 130 KB (`tex/build_tools.sh` has the numbers).
13. **The editor itself.** Done for the scripted part. `test/editor_corpus.py` makes six edits
    on the typeset page of every corpus document, where the page offers a place for them (type
    a word, delete one, bold one, extend a formula, type in a table cell, in a footnote), checks
    that each lands in the source where it was made and as itself, that Ctrl+Z gives the source
    back byte for byte, then compiles the edited project. On version 23: 222 of the 716 documents
    offer a place for at least one edit (the others are TikZ and other figures with no running
    text); of 792 edits tried, 780 land exactly (191 typed, 203 deleted, 202 bold, 111 formulas,
    56 table cells, 17 footnotes) and 12 formulas open as source by design (9 siunitx commands,
    3 formulas the equation field cannot hold); all 792 undo byte for byte; the 211 edited
    projects whose original compiles all compile. Results:
    `dev/editor-results.jsonl`, `dev/editor-compile.jsonl`. The runs found the six bugs above.
    The user test (`dev/usertest.md`: one hour, five people) is the owner's to run.
14. Left alone: the documents' own faults.
15. **License.** Done: the AGPL-3.0 text in `LICENSE`, the components in `NOTICE`.

## Open tasks

16. **The arXiv corpus** (task 3's finish line): compile rate and match rate on the 1,000
    papers, every failure classified as in task 2. Needs arxiv.org (see task 3).
## Tasks after round 2: status

17. **3D bitmaps from Asymptote.** Done in version 24. Mesa 24.0.5 (Ubuntu 24.04's source
    package, pinned by hash) is built with Emscripten 3.1.6 by `build_tools.sh mesa`: meson
    with `native/mesa-cross.ini`, OSMesa on softpipe, no LLVM, threads or window system, static
    libraries; `native/patch_mesa.py` lets Mesa take Emscripten for Linux (it is musl with a
    Linux system call layer), drops thread names and the CPU number, and makes OSMesa static.
    asy is configured with OpenGL and `--enable-offscreen` but no GLUT (two GLUT calls guarded),
    and links Mesa's GL instead of Emscripten's WebGL. asy forks a child to render each
    picture; WebAssembly has no fork, so asy renders in place and then copies back its memory
    below the heap's top, as it was before the render: the child's exit, in effect. Without
    that a run's later pictures inherited the first one's GL objects, and a picture with a
    transparent surface came out in an earlier picture's colours: asy's fragment counting pass
    copies each buffer's vertices but not its materials, and the drawing pass after it copies
    nothing; only a buffer's first use, in a fresh process always, forces the copy (a bug of
    asy's that a forked child never meets). The shaders are in the tree at TeX Live's place
    (`texmf-dist/asymptote/shaders`); `blend.glsl` compares an unsigned `n` with `1` and `0`,
    which GLSL 3.30 (softpipe's) rejects, so it gets `1u` and `0u`. Against a native asy built
    with the same Mesa (`dev/build_asy_native.sh`, `MESA=1`): 97 of the 220 examples render a
    bitmap there, and 94 of those are equal in Galley (two draw random data, one is
    `SierpinskiSponge`, task 9); runs of three pictures of different sizes, with transparency,
    are equal too, as are the corpus's three asy figures against the desktop (task 2). A clean
    `GALLEY_SRC` gives `asy.wasm` byte for byte. Cost: `asy.wasm` 3.7 → 13.3 MB (0.9 → 3.0 MB
    gzipped as shipped), artifact 251.8 MB. Time in Chromium against native: torus 2.1 s (0.7),
    teapot 16.9 s (6.5), genustwo 49.1 s (16.2); all 220 examples 857 s against 357.
18. **The four Asymptote examples Galley failed** (task 9). Done in version 24: all four equal
    the native asy's PDFs. `functionshading`, `layers` and `spectrum` did not hang in TeX's pipe
    but in asy: in the rehearsal (the first run, which only notes labels and where `System`
    fails) converting a layer with epstopdf failed, and `shipout`'s loop over the layers never
    moved past it. It stops now, as a failed shipout (`patch_asy.py`). `slidedemo` makes its
    figures with `asy()` between its TeX runs; the worker removed every new file of the folder
    before the next run of the same pipe session, so the slides lost `Pythagoras.pdf` and the
    others. Only the files TeX's own runs made are removed now (`engine.js`).
19. **Asymptote as the desktop's.** Done in version 25. Once the desktop reference ran its asy
    (task 2), Galley's could be held against Ubuntu's asy 3.11, the one a desktop TeX Live user
    has, and two examples failed in Galley only: `AiryDisk` (the gsl module) and `slope`. asy is
    now built with GSL 2.8, FFTW 3.3.11 and Eigen 3.4.0, the desktop's versions from Ubuntu
    26.10's source packages (`build_tools.sh`, and `build_asy_native.sh` likewise): the gsl
    module, `fft()` and `schur()`. `slope` stays a failure, measured: asy built without its
    garbage collector frees nothing until a run ends, and `slope` fills WebAssembly's 2 GB. Its
    Boehm GC was built and tried (static data registered as roots, binaryen's spill-pointers
    pass for the pointers in WebAssembly locals): 3D rendering two to three times slower, and
    `slope` still out of memory, with 1.5 GB in use after each collection where the desktop's
    64 bit asy peaks at 270 MB (likely false pointers: in 32 bits the heap spans most
    addresses). The worker now lets a program go when a run leaves its memory above 1 GiB and
    loads it again on the next call (`tools.js`): once, in task 9's run, the page had crashed
    after `slope`; now `slope` and three figures after it in one page give the three equal,
    asy loaded again in 6 s. Against the desktop's asy 3.11 now: 218 of 220 as task 9 counts
    them, `AiryDisk` equal; against the native asy built as Galley's, 219 (`slope` fails there
    too). A clean `GALLEY_SRC` gives `asy.wasm` byte for byte. Cost: `asy.wasm` 13.3 → 14.8 MB
    (3.0 → 3.5 MB gzipped), artifact 252.3 MB. All 220 examples take 1,410 s in Chromium against
    the desktop's 475 s (on a machine slower than task 17's).

## Rules

- No status commits ("Note ...", "Record ...") and no log in this file. One commit per
  finished task, its message saying what changed and the evidence (test counts, corpus count).
  If a task is blocked, say why under the task, once, and move on.
- Corpus results: one file, `dev/corpus-results.jsonl`, replaced by each full run; the
  comparison likewise in `dev/pdfcompare-results.jsonl`.
- Never put files into the tree by hand: kpathsea finds files through `ls-R`, which
  `build_tree.py tree` writes. Files reach the tree through a package in `CORE_SETS`,
  `DEB_SETS` or `FONT_PICKS`, or the `extra/` overlay, before `tree` runs.
- Commits use the author email `pedro.fernandezrackebrandt@merton.ox.ac.uk`.
- Compare against the real program, byte for byte, whenever one exists (xindy against CLISP's,
  PDFs against a desktop TeX Live). A plausible output is not the target.
- Patch original sources with small scripts that assert their anchor text exists, so a version
  bump fails loudly. Comments say why, in plain sentences.
- Run the corpus before publishing. Publishing to the claude.ai artifact needs Claude
  (`tex/publish_batches.py` plans the uploads, 256 MB limit); anywhere else, serve `dist/`.
